<h3>[ 2020-February-18 ]</h3>

<i>This post was originally shared <a href="https://medium.com/@jldlaughlin/how-does-homebrew-work-starring-rust-94ae5aa24552">on Medium</a></i>.

<p>Recently at <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, I created our first (and my first!) <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/homebrew-materialize">Homebrew package</a>. My helpful coworkers pointed me to documentation about <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook">how to write a Homebrew Formula</a>, but the guides I found online didn’t explain <b>how</b> installing software with Homebrew worked. In this post, I’m going to explain how Homebrew works by walking through a tiny example: brew installing a Rust program that simply prints “Hello, world!”.</p>

<h2>Hello, world! in Rust</h2>

<p>I’ve already created a “Hello, world!” program in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">Cargo</a>, Rust’s package manager, and pushed it to a <a href="https://github.com/JLDLaughlin/rust_hello_world">new GitHub repository</a>. (For the curious, this is the Rust program created by default when you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/creating-a-new-project.html">create a new Cargo package</a>).</p>

<p>To run this program locally on my computer, I ran the following two commands from my terminal:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html"><b>cargo build</b></a>: This tells Cargo to turn my high-level, human-readable Rust source code into instructions my computer’s processor can actually execute. The executable file, or binary, is then placed in my target/ directory.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html"><b>cargo run</b></a>: This tells Cargo to grab the newly-created binary file and have my computer’s processor execute its instructions, one line at a time.</p>
</ul>

<p>In short: <b>to run my Rust program, Cargo translated my source code into an executable file stored at a predictable location and then later handed that executable to my computer’s processor to run</b>.</p>

<h2>Introducing: Homebrew</h2>

<p>Now that we understand how our computers execute our Rust program, we actually understand how Homebrew works, too! Just like <b>cargo build && cargo run</b> creates a binary, stores it in a predictable location, and executes it, <b>Homebrew creates executables and installs them into a predictable location for your computer to execute later</b>. To take a closer look, let’s install our “Hello, world!” package!</p>

<h2>brew tap</h2>

<p>By default, Homebrew can only install <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">core Homebrew Formulae</a>. To install our third-party “Hello, world!” package, we will first need to run <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Taps">brew tap</a>. <b>Tap</b>-ing the Github repository with our Homebrew Formula creates a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt">shallow clone</a> of our repo in our Homebrew taps directory, allowing us to install, update, and track our package just like the canonical Homebrew packages.</p>

<img src="../images/brew_tap.jpg" alt="brew tap" height="180">

<p><i>Note: If you’re creating your own Homebrew Formula at home, you may see weird failures (like `git: “credential-osxkeychain” is not a git command`) at this step. Often, the trick is your Github repository must be named exactly `homebrew-*`.</i></p>

<p>Once we’ve tap-ed the repository with our Formula, running brew install hello_world from our terminal will install our package. But what does brew install actually do?</p>

<h2>brew install</h2>

<p>When we run <b>brew install</b>, Homebrew reads our package’s Formula — an implementation of <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/github/Homebrew/brew/Formula">Ruby’s abstract Formula class</a> that provides package metadata and installation instructions — to create an executable from our source code and install it locally on our computer. Let’s dig into this by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/JLDLaughlin/homebrew-hello-world/blob/master/Formula/hello_world.rb">Formula for `hello_world`</a>, section by section:</p>

<img src="../images/homebrew_formula.jpg" alt="homebrew_formula" height="125">

<p>This first section defines essential metadata for our Homebrew Formula:</p>

<ul>
<li>Desc: A simple description of our software</li>
<li>Homepage: Link to a homepage for our software</li>
<li>URL: The URL to download the source code for the Formula!</li>
<li>Version: Version of our software</li>
<li>SHA256: The sha256 checksum of our source code, in this case hello.tar.gz</li>
</ul>

<i>Note: To calculate the sha256 checksum of your source code, you can do the following:</i>

<img src="../images/homebrew_sha256.jpg" alt="sha256" height="50">

<p>Now that we’ve provided Homebrew with our package’s metadata, in the next section we tell Homebrew how to actually build it:</p>

<img src="../images/homebrew_install.jpg" alt="homebrew install and deps" height="150">

<ul>
<li>Depends_on: Any dependencies for our source code</li>
<li>Install: How to actually create an executable file from our source code — <i>notice we’re just using the same `cargo build` as before!</i></li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s (most of) our Formula! Since we’ve provided the necessary metadata and installation instructions for Homebrew, we can now run brew install hello_world in our terminal:</p>

<img src="../images/brew_install_terminal.jpg" alt="brew install terminal" height="300">

<p>We can see Homebrew is following our Formula by: downloading and installing our dependency (Rust), downloading our source code (hello.tar.gz), and running <b>cargo build —- release —- bin hello</b> to compile our code and put our binary in <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-does-homebrew-prefer-i-install-to-usrlocal">/usr/local/bin</a>.</p>

<p><i>Note: Homebrew installs packages into /usr/local/bin because this directory location is already on your Mac’s PATH — this means you can execute the newly created binary by name without providing an explicit path to it!</i></p>

<h2>Hello, World! via Homebrew</h2>

<p>Just like cargo build created an executable from our Rust code and put the binary in a predictable location, brew install created an executable from our Formula and placed it on our Mac’s PATH. Just like cargo run executed the binary in /target, invoking hello directly in our terminal will execute the binary installed on our PATH:</p>
